This example shows you how to use bots as services. When learning, it's intended to look through the files in the following order:
- [Startup.cs](./Startup.cs) (In the "ConfigureServices" method you can see how the bots are registered)
- [appsettings.json](./appsettings.json) (Bot settings file)
- [Bot.cs](./Bot.cs) (Here you can see how to configure extensions)

*You must enter a token in appsettings.json.*
